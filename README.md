# Atlas

Dotfiles for my current Arch Linux setup featuring the
[atlas](https://github.com/huyvohcmc/atlas.vim) colour scheme. 

## Background

This is a setup tailored for my R use. I was using RStudio for my R work but then I found a more
minimal workflow could be achieved using Neovim and [Nvim-R}(https://github.com/jalvesaq/Nvim-R) and
tmux. I also use [radian](https:github.com/randy3k/radian) for my R console as it also can be
integrated into Nvim-R. 

## Installation

I generally recommend [`GNU stow`}(https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) for setting this up on your
machine but it ususally requires some packages to be installed first. I would suggest that anyone
interested in using this lookth through this first before running `stow`.
